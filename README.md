# Self-Driving Car Steering Control Project Report

This repository contains the project report for my internship where I worked on a self-driving car steering control project. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the steering control algorithms implemented in the [Autopilot-TensorFlow](https://github.com/SullyChen/Autopilot-TensorFlow) code repository.

## Project Overview
During my internship, I had the opportunity to study and analyze the Autopilot-TensorFlow codebase, which is a cutting-edge implementation of a self-driving car model using deep learning. The primary focus of my work was to understand the steering control algorithms employed by the model and document my findings in this project report.

## Contents
The repository includes the following files:
